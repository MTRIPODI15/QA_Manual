#  QA Manual – Functional Test Cases

Welcome to the **QA_Manual** repository.  
This project contains examples of manual test cases with different levels of difficulty and types of functionality.

## Purpose

The goal is to share clear and organized documentation for manual QA testing.  
Each test case is written in Markdown and follows a simple structure to help other testers and developers understand the process.

## Structure

- **Basic Tests** – Simple cases for login, registration, and navigation
- **Advanced Tests** – Full flows like checkout, cart validation, and error handling
- **Executed Tests** – Real test cases with screenshots, results, and metrics

## Progress

This repository will grow with new examples and improvements over time.  
Feel free to explore, learn, and use these cases for your own QA practice.
